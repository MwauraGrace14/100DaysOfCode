# 100DaysOfCode
## Day001:March 11th
### Today's progress : 
#### I started on the introduction to Python. I Learnt about the Python input function, the python variables and naming the variables
### Thoughts
#### I've realised that for me , Using Replit while coding in Python is a bit friendly compared to using VS code. I purpose to practise coding in Python on both Replit and VS code

## Day002:March 12th
### Today's progress: 
#### Today I learnt about the various data-types in python, how to manipulate strings and how to do various mathematical operations in python. 
#### From that i came up with a tip calculator that helps calculate bills.
### Thoughts:
#### Understanding the core datatypes in python lays a solid foundation for programming in python and now every line of code you work with automatically makes more sense.

## Day003:March 13th
### Today's progress: 
#### Today I learnt about the control flow including the If/else, nested if and also implementing multiple if statements. 
#### I generated various codes eg one that calculate one's Body Mass Index(BMI) and outputs the BMI and gives an interpretation of their BMI.
### Thoughts:
#### It's getting more interesting!

## Day004:March 14th
### Today's progress: 
#### Today I learnt about the logical operators and,or,not and how to implement them. 
#### Remember the love calculator game we used to play in highschool?ðŸ˜†I decided to create that game today.
#### I also came up with a treasure island game to find a hidden gem. Interesting,right?ðŸ˜‚
### Thoughts:
#### At least i got to interact with an ASCII ART for the very first time.("Hidden gem in codingðŸ˜‰")

## Day005:March 15th
### Today's progress:
#### I learnt about randomisation including the random module and python lists.
#### I also learnt about index errors and how to correct them in python.
### Thoughts:
#### So far so good!
####

## Day 006:March 16th
### Today's progress:
#### I used the knowledge previously learnt from Day 005 to create a game involving a treasure box.
### Thoughts:
#### Interesting,right??ðŸ˜‚
### Link to work - https://github.com/MwauraGrace14/Lists.py.git

## Day 007:March 17th
### Today's progress
#### I learnt about the for loop and how to implement the range() function in python.
### Thoughts:
#### If only Bart Simpson on that one episode of the Simpsons knew how to use the FOR loop, then it would have been easy for him to do his punishment instead of writing the same statement over and over againðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.

## Day 008:March 18th
### Today's progress:
#### Today I generated two codes using the concept of the FOR loop and Python lists: One is a rock,paper,scissors game and the the other code auto generates a password using inputs given by the user.
### Thoughts
#### Might as well end up coming up with my own games in this journeyðŸ˜‚.

## Day 009:March 19th
### Today's progress:
#### I learnt how to define and call python functions and also indentation as a necessity in python.
#### I also interacted with the Reeborg's world, for the very first time and I got to play the Hurdles Loop challenge in Python.
### Thoughts:
#### After implementing function calls and definitions: "Of course we are programmers, we love to be lazy"ðŸ˜…

## Day 010:March 20th
### Today's progress:
#### I learnt about the while loop and how it operates. I still used the Reeborg's world site to practise on the while loop.
### Thoughts:
#### I'm loving the progress.

## Day 011: March 21st
### Today's progress
#### Ever heard of the hangman game??.That's what i decided to work on today using all the concepts i've learnt in python so far.
### Thoughts:
#### Would definitely love being involved in coming up with games kids can interact with.They are so fun!

## Day 012 : March 22nd
### Today's progress:
#### I learnt how to improve the user experience on my game by implementing the ASCII art to improve the UI on my games
### Thoughts
#### Everyday is a learning day!
### Link to work - 
#### I updated the game i created on Day 011 
#### https://github.com/MwauraGrace14/Day10.py.git

## Day 013: March 24th
### Today's progress:
#### I've advanced my knowledge on functions.I've learnt how to use functions with inputs in python.
#### I've also learnt about the positional and keyword arguments.
### Thoughts
#### Parameters and arguments can really be confusing while differentiating them.

## Day 014: March 26th
### Today's progress
#### I learnt about dictionaries and how you can nest lists and dictionaries.
### Link to work
#### https://github.com/MwauraGrace14/Day14-Dictionaries.py.git

## Day 015: March 30th
### Today's progress
#### I learnt how to use functions with outputs and also how to use multiple return values.
#### I integrated dictionaries and functions in my calculator app.
#### I can now differentiate how the return and print functions operate.
### Thoughts
#### You can actually manipulate a computer to literally do what you want. I mean, I never knew I can write some documentations for the functions i've created, using docstrings in python.ðŸ˜…

## Day 016: March 31st
### Today's progress:
#### I wrote a code that plays the Caesar Cipher game where you get to encode and decode a certain text with some hidden meaning.
### Thoughts:
#### Interesting,right?ðŸ˜…

## Day 017:April 1st
### Today's progress
#### Decided to go through what I've learnt so far and also the mini projects i have so farr.
### Thoughts
#### After learning a new skill I really need to use it often, to be able to understand it well and do a deeper research on it.
