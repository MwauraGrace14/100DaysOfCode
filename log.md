# 100DaysOfCode
## Day001:March 11th
### Today's progress : 
#### I started on the introduction to Python. I Learnt about the Python input function, the python variables and naming the variables
### Thoughts
#### I've realised that for me , Using Replit while coding in Python is a bit friendly compared to using VS code. I purpose to practise coding in Python on both Replit and VS code

## Day002:March 12th
### Today's progress: 
#### Today I learnt about the various data-types in python, how to manipulate strings and how to do various mathematical operations in python. 
#### From that i came up with a tip calculator that helps calculate bills.
### Thoughts:
#### Understanding the core datatypes in python lays a solid foundation for programming in python and now every line of code you work with automatically makes more sense.
