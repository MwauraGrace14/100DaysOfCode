# 100DaysOfCode
## Day001:March 11th
### Today's progress : 
#### I started on the introduction to Python. I Learnt about the Python input function, the python variables and naming the variables
### Thoughts
#### I've realised that for me , Using Replit while coding in Python is a bit friendly compared to using VS code. I purpose to practise coding in Python on both Replit and VS code

## Day002:March 12th
### Today's progress: 
#### Today I learnt about the various data-types in python, how to manipulate strings and how to do various mathematical operations in python. 
#### From that i came up with a tip calculator that helps calculate bills.
### Thoughts:
#### Understanding the core datatypes in python lays a solid foundation for programming in python and now every line of code you work with automatically makes more sense.

## Day003:March 13th
### Today's progress: 
#### Today I learnt about the control flow including the If/else, nested if and also implementing multiple if statements. 
#### I generated various codes eg one that calculate one's Body Mass Index(BMI) and outputs the BMI and gives an interpretation of their BMI.
### Thoughts:
#### It's getting more interesting!

## Day004:March 14th
### Today's progress: 
#### Today I learnt about the logical operators and,or,not and how to implement them. 
#### Remember the love calculator game we used to play in highschool?ðŸ˜†I decided to create that game today.
#### I also came up with a treasure island game to find a hidden gem. Interesting,right?ðŸ˜‚
### Thoughts:
#### At least i got to interact with an ASCII ART for the very first time.("Hidden gem in codingðŸ˜‰")

## Day005:March 15th
### Today's progress:
#### I learnt about randomisation including the random module and python lists.
#### I also learnt about index errors and how to correct them in python.
### Thoughts:
#### So far so good!

## Day 006:March 16th
### Today's progress:
#### I used the knowledge previously learnt from Day 005 to create a game involving a treasure box.
### Thoughts:
#### Interesting,right??ðŸ˜‚

## Day 007:March 17th
### Today's progress
#### I learnt about the for loop and how to implement the range() function in python.
### Thoughts:
#### If only Bart Simpson on that one episode of the Simpsons knew how to use the FOR loop, then it would have been easy for him to do his punishment instead of writing the same statement over and over againðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.
