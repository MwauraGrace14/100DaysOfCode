# 100DaysOfCode
## Day001:March 1th
### Today's progress : 
#### I started on the introduction to Python. I Learnt about the Python input function, the python variables and naming the variables
### Thoughts
#### I've realised that for me , Using Replit while coding in Python is a bit friendly compared to using VS code. I purpose to practise coding in Python on both Replit and VS code
